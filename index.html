                <p>Here at SkillSwap, our aim is to connect those who know something with those looking to learn it. Instead of hiding what we do under inspiring statements, we are clear: we build technology to ease knowledge sharing and gather the most value possible from both participants.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>We focus on making sure our investors get the best results by setting up a digital platform for sharing knowledge, with people providing the content, taking teaching risks and managing the quality, while we gather data, charge commissions and grow without additional costs.</p>

            <div class="citation">SkillSwap is an example of platform capitalism because it turns individual skills into financial services, classrooms into payment-based agreements and protection for teachers into flexible job offers (Srnicek, 2017).</div>

                    <h4>Step 2: Algorithmic Management and Control</h4>
                    <p>Unlike schools run by people, our algorithms are examples of "algorithmic governance", meaning fully automated decisions as Kitchin (2017) mentions.</p>
                    <div class="citation">What Bucher (2018) calls "programmed sociality" here is how our algorithm decides who interacts, mostly to improve our profits rather than focusing on students' learning.</div>

                    <h4>Step 3: The Rating and Reputation System</h4>
                    <p>Our framework highlights what Fourcade and Healy (2017) label as "classification situations," where people are organized by platform metrics.</p>
                    <div class="citation">Due to this, Rosenblat and Stark (2016) call it 'algorithmic management', where businesses measure and monitor instead of managing face-to-face.</div>

                    <h4>Step 4: Network Effect Cultivation</h4>
                    <p>Our approach depends completely on what Parker et al. (2016) call "network effects," which makes the platform more valuable as more users get involved.</p>
                    <div class="citation">In the same way Rochet and Tirole (2003) described, we offer reduced costs for learners to draw in many skill providers.</div>

                    <h4>Step 5: Risk and Responsibility Displacement</h4>
                    <p>The system we use strongly demonstrates what Hill (2015) describes as a shift in employment policies, greatly shifting risks from organizations to individuals.</p>
                    <div class="citation">The advantages for knowledge providers are limited to certification, managing how they are seen and content creation, whereas we keep what Pasquale (2015) called "algorithmic authority".</div>

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>We show at SkillSwap that the idea of "the rise in the platform economy" (as explained by Kenney and Zysman in 2016) is transforming how knowledge is recognized and shared.</p>

            <div class="impact-item">
                <h3>Economic "Empowerment"</h3>
                <p>Ravenelle (2019) lists our platform as an example of the "hustle economy" a situation where individuals are required to make money using their own knowledge and skills. The trend Standing (2011) observed is that the "precariat" made up of online knowledge workers who are often without financial stability, is becoming more prominent.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="impact-item">
                <h3>Educational "Democratization"</h3>
                <p>The platform we have shows what Williamson (2017) means by "platform education" the transformation of education by market technologies. Our approach, what Watters (2014) terms "ed-tech solutionism," suggests that technology can resolve educational challenges, even as it ignores the underlying factors that decide who takes advantage.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="impact-item">
                <h3>Community "Building"</h3>
                <p>SkillSwap demonstrates what van Dijck (2013) means by "platformed sociality" or social ties only formed through a commercial platform. As a result, this is what Floridi (2015) terms "onlife" the mixture of online and offline activities, where learning connections are frequently handled over commercial sites.</p>

        <section class="section" id="investors">
            <h2>Investor relations</h2>
            <p>SkillSwap fits into what Kenney and Zysman (2016) explain as "platform capitalism": a way to make maximum profit at minimal direct expense.</p>

            <div class="honest-box">
                <h4>Core Architecture: Algorithmic Control</h4>
                <p>Our platform follows the idea described by Gillespie (2010), known as "the politics of platforms," where neutral technology is used to exert power. We use algorithms referred to by Yeung (2017) as "hypernudge" to direct users to decisions that benefit the platform, while keeping it seem it is following their own decisions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="honest-box">
                <h4>Sustainable and Expandable Business Model</h4>
                <p>The process by which we achieved profitability fits the platform business lifecycle described in Srnicek's (2017) study. It means what Langley and Leyshon (2017) call platform capitalism, where we keep finding new fields for platforms and growing our dependency on their infrastructure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="honest-box">
                <h4>Future Vision</h4>
                <p>Our method for the future closely aligns with what Morozov (2019) terms "data extractivism," which means continual growth in areas where data is collected and valuable. We demonstrate what van Dijck et al. (2018) refer to as "platformization" the introduction of platform systems into fields of education that used to be free of markets.</p>

                <strong>Investment Opportunity</strong>
